# Vercel Blob Setup

This document explains how to set up Vercel Blob for file storage in your application.

## Environment Variables

You need to add the following environment variable to your `.env.local` file and your Vercel project settings:

```env
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here
```

## How to Get Your Vercel Blob Token

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to the "Storage" tab
4. Click "Create Database" and select "Blob"
5. Once created, you'll see your `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
6. Copy this token and add it to your environment variables

## Local Development

For local development, create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_your_token_here
```

## Production Deployment

In your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` with your token value
3. Set it for Production, Preview, and Development environments

## Usage

The blob functionality is now available in your `/organisation/xero` page with:

- **File Upload**: Drag and drop or click to upload files
- **File Browser**: View, download, and delete uploaded files
- **File Management**: Files are stored securely in Vercel Blob

## Security

- Files are set to public access by default (you can modify this in the API routes)
- Authentication is required to upload, list, or delete files
- File URLs are generated by Vercel and are secure

## File Size Limits

- Default limit is 5MB per file (can be increased based on your Vercel plan)
- You can modify the limits in the upload component if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set correctly
2. Verify the token has read/write permissions
3. Check the browser console for any error messages
4. Ensure you're authenticated before trying to upload files
