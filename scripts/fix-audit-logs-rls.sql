-- Fix for audit logs RLS policy issues
-- Run this script to resolve the "row-level security policy" violations

-- First, drop existing policies that are causing issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own logs" ON audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view audit logs" ON audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access" ON audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can insert logs" ON audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon role to insert audit logs" ON audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon role to view audit logs" ON audit_logs;

-- Create simple, permissive policies for now (you can tighten security later)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON audit_logs
    FOR ALL
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Alternative: If you want to disable RLS temporarily for testing
-- ALTER TABLE audit_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the setup

    'Audit logs RLS policies updated successfully' as status,
