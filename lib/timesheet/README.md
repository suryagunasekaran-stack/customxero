# Timesheet Processing Architecture

## Overview
This module implements a clean, maintainable architecture for timesheet processing functionality following SOLID principles and best practices.

## Architecture

### Controller Pattern
- **TimesheetProcessingController**: Main orchestrator that coordinates the entire processing workflow
- Implements the Facade pattern to provide a simple interface to complex subsystems
- Uses callbacks for communication with UI components

### Service Layer
The business logic is separated into focused service classes:

1. **FileValidationService**
   - Validates file format and size
   - Creates file previews
   - Single responsibility: File validation

2. **TenantService**
   - Fetches Xero tenant information
   - Handles API communication for tenant data
   - Single responsibility: Tenant management

3. **ProcessingStepService**
   - Manages processing step states
   - Tracks progress and timing
   - Single responsibility: Step orchestration

4. **TimesheetProcessingService**
   - Handles the main API call for processing
   - Manages error handling and logging
   - Single responsibility: Timesheet processing

5. **ReportService**
   - Handles report generation and downloads
   - Manages file creation and cleanup
   - Single responsibility: Report management

### UI Components
Presentational components with clear responsibilities:

1. **FileUploadSection**
   - Handles file selection UI
   - Shows upload errors
   - Pure presentational component

2. **ProcessingStepsDisplay**
   - Displays processing progress
   - Shows step-by-step status
   - Real-time updates

3. **ProcessingResults**
   - Shows processing results
   - Handles result actions (download, retry)
   - Formats success/error states

4. **TimesheetProcessingCardRefactored**
   - Main container component
   - Manages local state
   - Coordinates between controller and UI

## Design Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class has one reason to change:
- Services handle specific business logic
- UI components handle specific presentation concerns
- Controller orchestrates without implementing details

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Services can be extended without modifying existing code
- New processing steps can be added to the workflow
- UI components accept props for customization

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Controller depends on service abstractions
- UI components depend on interfaces (props)
- Easy to mock/test individual components

### Separation of Concerns
- Business logic separated from UI
- API calls isolated in services
- State management centralized in controller

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Common functionality extracted to services
- Reusable UI components
- Shared types and interfaces

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Each component has a clear, simple purpose
- Complex logic broken down into manageable pieces
- Easy to understand and maintain

## Usage

```typescript
import { TimesheetProcessingCard } from '@/components/xero';

// The component is now using the refactored architecture internally
<TimesheetProcessingCard disabled={false} />
```

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Each service can be unit tested independently
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes changes easier
3. **Reusability**: Services can be used in other contexts
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
5. **Readability**: Code is organized and self-documenting

## Future Enhancements

1. Add dependency injection for services
2. Implement service interfaces for better abstraction
3. Add comprehensive error recovery strategies
4. Implement caching for tenant information
5. Add progress persistence for long-running operations
